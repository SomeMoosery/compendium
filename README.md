# I'll sleep when I'm rich
This repo aims to be my compendium of knowledge over my career as a softawre engineer, starting in January 2020 going into my sixth month at my first role as a software engineer at Capital One.

I'll be continuosly updating, improving, and adding to this repository hopefully throughout my entire career in software if not tech overall. I've had so many notebooks, scraps of paper, tabs open, notes on my phone, etc that I figured I would combine everything into one central, vast resource that I hope to keep as organized and poignant as possible.

If anyone stumbles across this, I hope you enjoy.
