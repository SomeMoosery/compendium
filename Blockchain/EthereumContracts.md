## Concepts
State variables are permanently stored on-chain, so they can be used like an on-chain database. As such, they are expensive. See definition below

When calling another contract, we need to first create an interface for that contract within our own contract. So, if we had a contract we wanted to call: 


```solidity
contract LuckyNumber {
  mapping(address => uint) numbers;

  function setNum(uint _num) public {
    numbers[msg.sender] = _num;
  }

  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint) {
    return numbers[_myAddress];
  }
}
```

We would have to define 

```solidity
contract NumberInterface {
  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint);
}
```

within our own contract first. We have to create the interface that the contract inherits.

**Pass by value** is when the Solidity compiler creates a new copy of the parameter's value and passes it to your function. This allows your function to modify the value without worrying that the value of the initial parameter gets changed. **Pass by reference** means that the function is called with a reference to the original variable. Thus, if your function changes the value of the variable it receives, the value of the original variable gets changed.
- using the `memory` keyword passes by value and is necessary for all reference types like arrays, structs, mappings, strings

It's _convention_ to start function param variable names with an underscore (i.e. `_var`) in order to differentiate from global variables

Functions are public by default (anyone, or any other contract, can call your contract's function and execute its code)
- you should make functions `private` by default
- `private` functions should be prefaced with an underscore like function parameters (i.e. `_createPerson(...) private {...}`)

**Pure functions** should be marked as `pure`

**View funcions** should be marked as `view` 

Strings, arrays, structs, mappings still need `memory` in return value (i.e. `returns (string memory)`)

In Solidity, function execution must always start with an external caller. There will always be a `msg.sender`

## Global variables / functions 
* `msg.sender`: the address of the person (or smart contract) which called the current function
* `emit` emits an `event` to the frontend
* `require` makes it so that the function will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not true

## Definitions:
**Contract:** the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications â€” all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects

**Storage (pointer):** variables stored permanently on the blockchain (like a hard disk, database). _State variables are `storage` by default_!!

**Memory:** variables that are temporary, erased between external function calls to your contract (like RAM). These variables are declared within functions.

**State Variables:** variables permanently stored in contract storage i.e. written to the Ethereum blockchain. These variables must be declared outside of functions. **This is like a database write** (i.e. they're expensive)
- Creating a dynamic array of structs can be useful for storing data in your contract, **kind of like an on-chain database**
- Adding `public` in the variable definition generates a `getter()` function and allows other contracts to read from (but not write to) that variable

**Pure functions:** functions that do not read from state and only deal with function parameters

**View functions:** functions that don't change any values or write anything

**Event:** a way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be "listening" for certain events and take action when they happen

**Internal:** The same as `private`, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from the declaring contract

**External:** The same as `public`, except that it can ONLY be called outside the contract (not by other functions inside that contract)

## Smart Contract Structure
* Every smart contract needs a _version pragma_ i.e. a version declaration 

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

    // event
    event NewPerson(uint personId, string name, uint dna)

    // struct
    struct Person {
        uint age;
        string name;
    }

    // map
    mapping (uint => address) public map;

    // state varible. This will be stored permanently in the blockchain
    uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;

    // a public array of People (i.e. kind of like an on-chain database)
    Person[] public people;

    // a private function that passes _name from memory (i.e. by value)
    function _createPerson (string memory _name, uint _dna) private {
        // Emit this action to be handled by a callback in your frontend
        uint id = people.push(Person(_name, _dna)) -1 ;
        emit NewPerson(id, _name, _dna);
    }

    // A private view function that returns a uint
    function _generateRandomDna (string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
        // generates random hash using built-in keccak256 function, and casts it as a uint
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));

        // returns 16-digit
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    // A private pure function that returns a uint
    function _multiply(uint _a, uint _b) private pure returns (uint) {
        return a * b;
    }

    // Creates a random person
    function createRandomPerson(string memroy _name) public {
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        _createPerson(_name, randDna);
    }
}
```
