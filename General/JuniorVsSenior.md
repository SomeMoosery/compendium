## JUNIOR DEVELOPER
- “working software” is equivalent to “good software” 
- requires other developers to help them complete complex tasks
- growth is perceived as learning new technologies/tools

## MID-LEVEL DEVELOPER
- the general craft of coding is more or less mastered by now, and most technologies (or at least common concepts are well-known and understood)
- can operate on their own to solve targeted technical problems, can make “working software” very efficiently
- might misalign goals (for example, squeezing out a bit faster performance for a huge cost in complexity)

## SENIOR DEVELOPER
- knows that they know nothing (while still having mastered quite a bit)
- can write “good software” - software that does what it’s supposed to do and can scale
- doesn't think in terms of individual classes, methods, functions, low-level technical particulars, but in terms of object-oriented and application design patterns
- thinks about people that have to work with the code, not just making the code work
