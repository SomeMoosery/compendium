# Declarative Paradigms

**Logic, functional, and domain-specific** languages belong within declarative paradigms (i.e. HTML, XML, Haskell, SQL)

Focuses on building logic of software without actually describing its flow (i.e. saying _what_ without adding the _how_)
- Not always Turing-complete (but mostly is)

Functional programming based on lambda calculus is Turing complete, avoids states, side effects, and mutation of data. You create expressions (not statements) and evalutate functions.
- No loops
- For the same argument, a function will always return the same value
