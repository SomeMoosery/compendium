Web Application & Software Architecture 101:

Tiers of Applications:
1. 1-Tier: All the code is on one machine (client, database, everything) - this is what like video games, MS Excel, etc are
2. 2-Tier: All the client code and business logic is on one machine, while the database is on another 
3. 3-Tier: The client is on one machine, the business logic (web server) is on another, and the database on a third
4. N-Tier Application: Distributed Application: a three-tier application with more components such as:
    - Cache
    - Message queues for asynchronous behavior
    - Load balancers
    - Search servers for searching through massive amounts of data
    - Components involved in processing massive amounts of data
    - Components running heterogeneous tech (web services, microservices)
